            <p class="text-lg mt-4">Variable declaration in JavaScript can be performed in different ways with three
                keywords; var, let, and
                const. If you are not clear about the main differences between these keywords and when to choose one
                over the other, this post is for you.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before we get into details, let’s first understand what scope is:
            </p>

            <h4 class=" text-xl font-bold mt-8 ">Variable Scope</h4>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">Scope refers to the visibility of a variable in JavaScript, this means that a
                variable is not accessible
                outside the scope in which it is defined.

                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Global Scope:</span> Variables declared outside of a function or a
                block have global scope and are accessible
                from everywhere in the code.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Local Scope:</span> Variables declared inside a function or a block
                have local scope and they are accessible
                only within that function or block, not accessible from the global scope. There are two types of local
                scope in JavaScript:
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul class="list-decimal px-2">

                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Function Scope:</span> When a new function is declared, it
                    creates its own scope. Variables defined in the
                    function are bound to it and can not be accessed outside the function.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Block Scope:</span> A code block in JavaScript can be defined
                    using {curly braces} and variables defined
                    inside of a block statement like if conditions or for and while loops are block scoped. This means
                    that variables defined inside of a block are accessible only within that curly brace. Let’s take a
                    look at an example:</li>

            </ul>

            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="./blog image/1.00.png" alt="">


            <p class="text-lg mt-4">The first and second console.log(color1) both log the variable color1 because it is
                declared in the
                global scope.

                The first console.log(color2) logs the variable color2 successfully because it is accessible within the
                function addColor, whereas the second console.log(color2) throws an error because the variable color2 is
                not visible outside of its scope.
                <br>
                Now, let’s explain what the keywords var, let, and const are:
            </p>


            <h4 class=" text-xl font-bold mt-8 ">Var</h4>

            <p class="text-lg mt-4">Var was the only keyword used to declare variables in JavaScript before let and
                const were introduced
                recently with ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). Var declarations are either globally scoped or locally (function)
                scoped, but not block scoped.
                <br>
                Var can be updated and redeclared within the same scope without getting an error. The second variable
                you declared with var overwrites the first one. This might cause you to accidentally overwrite the value
                of the existing variable with the same name and debugging becomes hard in this situation.
            </p>


            <h4 class=" text-xl font-bold mt-8 ">Let</h4>

            <p class="text-lg mt-4">ES6 introduced the new keyword let in 2015. The main difference between var and let
                is that var is
                function scoped while let is block scoped. When a variable is declared with let in if statement or for
                loop, it is only valid in that block and this helps to debug your code easily.

                Let can be updated within its scope like var, but let can not be redeclared within its scope. This is
                why it is better to use let because it reduces the potential error of redeclaring a variable
                accidentally more than once within the same scope like var does.</p>

            <h4 class=" text-xl font-bold mt-8 ">Const</h4>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">Declaration of the variables with const is similar to let and it is block scoped.
                The difference between
                const and let is that a new value can not be assigned to a variable with const after the initial value
                is set, which means that const creates constant variables within its scope.
                <br>
                Let’s look at the example below to understand the differences in their scope:
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="./blog image/2.00.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">All the variables are accessible within the same if statement/block. Although the
                variable color1 is
                still visible out of the block because of its function scope, the other two variables color2 and color3
                are not valid anymore because we can access these two variables only within the curly braces they are
                declared in. Lastly, there is no access to any of those variables out of the function, because they are
                not globally scoped.
                <br>
                Here is a table to summarize what we have discussed:

            <br>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4 mb-20">Generally, it is advised to avoid using var. The best practice is to use const
                as a
                default option unless
                you need to reassign the variable in for loops or switch statements, in that case, let will be a better
                option.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Here you will learn what is null and undefined in JavaScript and what is the
                difference between them.</p>

            <h4 class=" text-xl font-bold mt-8 ">What is a null?</h4>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">A null means the absence of a value. You assign a null to a variable with the
                intention that currently this variable does not have any value but it will have later on. It is like a
                placeholder for a value. The type of null is the object.</p>

            <img src="./blog image/4.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Sometimes, null variables are the result of erroneous code. For example, if you try
                to find an HTML element using document.getElelementByID() with the wrong id, then it will return null.
                So it is recommended to check for null before doing something with that element.</p>

            <img src="./blog image/5.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4 class=" text-xl font-bold mt-8 ">What is undefined?</h4>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4"> A variable is undefined when you haven't assigned any value yet, not even a null.
            </p>

            <img src="./blog image/6.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Generally, variables are undefined when you forgot to assign values or change
                existing code. For example, consider the following Greet() function that returns a string.</p>
            <img src="./blog image/7.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Now, suppose somebody changes the function as below. So now, str will be undefined.

            <br>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Thus, undefined variables are the result of some code problems.</p>

            <h4 class=" text-xl font-bold mt-8 ">Difference between null and undefined</h4>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">You must explicitly assign a null to a variable. A variable has undefined when no
                value assigned to it.</p>

            <br>

            <br>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">The type of null variable is object whereas the type of undefined variable is
                "undefined".</p>

            <br>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Use the === operator to check whether a variable is null or undefined. The ==

            <img src="./blog image/12.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <p>The null and undefined variables are falsy to if-statements and ternary operators.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">A null variable treated as 0 in an numeric expression whereas undefined variable

            <h1 class="font-extrabold text-5xl my-10">What is a REST API?</h1>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how
                applications or devices
                can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design
                principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST
                APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
                <br>
                <br>
                First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST provides
                a relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one reason
                why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and applications in a
                microservices architecture.
            </p>

            <br>
           
            <br>

            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl my-8">REST design principles</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                At the most basic level, an API is a mechanism that enables an application or service to access a
                resource within another application or service. The application or service doing the accessing is called
                the client, and the application or service containing the resource is called the server.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-decimal px-2">
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Uniform interface.</span> All API requests for the same
                    resource should look the same, no matter where the
                    request comes from. The REST API should ensure that the same piece of data, such as the name or
                    email address of a user, belongs to only one uniform resource identifier (URI). Resources shouldn’t
                    be too large but should contain every piece of information that the client might need.</li>
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Client-server decoupling.</span> In REST API design, client and
                    server applications must be completely
                    independent of each other. The only information the client application should know is the URI of the
                    requested resource; it can't interact with the server application in any other ways. Similarly, a
                    server application shouldn't modify the client application other than passing it to the requested
                    data via HTTP.</li>
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Statelessness.</span> REST APIs are stateless, meaning that
                    each request needs to include all the
                    information necessary for processing it. In other words, REST APIs do not require any server-side
                    sessions. Server applications aren’t allowed to store any data related to a client request.</li>
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Cacheability.</span> When possible, resources should be
                    cacheable on the client or server side. Server
                    responses also need to contain information about whether caching is allowed for the delivered
                    resource. The goal is to improve performance on the client side, while increasing scalability on the
                    server side.
                </li>
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Layered system architecture.</span> In REST APIs, the calls and
                    responses go through different layers. As a
                    rule of thumb, don’t assume that the client and server applications connect directly to each other.
                    There may be a number of different intermediaries in the communication loop. REST APIs need to be
                    designed so that neither the client nor the server can tell whether it communicates with the end
                    application or an intermediary.</li>
                <li><span class="text-xl font-bold mb-44">Code on demand (optional).</span> REST APIs usually send
                    static resources, but in certain cases, responses
                    can also contain executable code (such as Java applets). In these cases, the code should only run
                    on-demand.</li>


            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <br>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl my-8">How REST APIs work</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like
                creating, reading,
                updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API would use
                a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and
                a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A well-designed REST API is
                similar to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.
                <br>
                <br>
                The state of a resource at any particular instant, or timestamp, is known as the resource
                representation. This information can be delivered to a client in virtually any format including
                JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is popular because it’s
                readable by both humans and machines—and it is programming language-agnostic.
                <br>
                <br>
                Request headers and parameters are also important in REST API calls because they include important
                identifier information such as metadata, authorizations, uniform resource identifiers (URIs), caching,
                cookies and more. Request headers and response headers, along with conventional HTTP status codes, are
                used within well-designed REST APIs.
            </p>
            <br>
          
            <br>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl my-8">REST API best practices</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Although flexibility is a big advantage of REST API design, that same flexibility
                makes it easy to design
                an API that’s broken or performs poorly. For this reason, professional developers share best practices
                in REST API specifications.

                <br>
                The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) establishes an interface for describing an API in a way that allows any
                developer or application to discover it and fully understand its parameters and capabilities - available
                endpoints, allowed operations on each endpoint, operation parameters, authentication methods, and other
                information. The latest version, OAS3 (link resides outside ibm.com), includes with hands-on tools, such
                as the OpenAPI Generator, for generating API clients and server stubs in different programming
                languages.

                Securing a REST API also starts with industry best practices, such as using hashing algorithms for
                password security and HTTPS for secure data transmission. An authorization framework like OAuth 2.0
                (link resides outside ibm.com) can help limit the privileges of third-party applications. Using a
                timestamp in the HTTP header, an API can also reject any request that arrives after a certain time
                period. Parameter validation and JSON Web Tokens are other ways to ensure that only authorized clients
                can access the API.
